Introduction
=====
Biological tissues are classically subdivided by discrete compartmental niches pre-defined through careful examination by histologists. However, the distributions of cells *within* these discrete structures are determined by orchestrated signalling events during development, differentiation, or migration, following autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signalling.

A Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) is broadly defined as a set of rules that allows reserchers and phisicians to develop a common language when discussing a morpholocial tissue location. The best, and in some sense, the only example of sucessful CCF is the [1]_

In an attempt to account to what a cell is "sensing" or to position a cell in continuous space. The OrganAxis approach aims too account for both local and global influences within and between structures. By deriving a "position" or a score to how much the cell is infuenced by it's proximity to structure. In the thymus, T cells mature throught migration within the compartments of the thymus. Since we assume that these migration eventsare driven by signaling molucules diffusion, we would fit a non-liear association that is dependent on the distance from nearby morphological structures.
