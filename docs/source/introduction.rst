Introduction
=====
Biological tissues are classically subdivided by discrete compartmental niches pre-defined through careful examination by histologists. However, the distributions of cells within these discrete structures are determined by orchestrated signalling events during development, differentiation, or migration, following autocrine, paracrine and endocrine signalling driven by molecular diffusion.
OrganAxis approach aims too establishes a continuous axis that accounts for both local and global influences within and between structures.
