Welcome to OrganAxis documentation!
===================================

**OrganAxis** is a computational approach for the construction of a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) from a set of spatial landmarks.

**Key features:**

* Can be applied to any spatial platform, at any resolution
* Allows multisample integration of continuous spatial information
* Allows modelling of linear and non-linear spatial associations to account for local and global spatial environments
* Hypothesis-driven - you need to know your tissue to derive an axis

OrganAxis is implemented to derive the human thymus cortico-medullary axis (CMA) here - https://github.com/Teichlab/thymus_spatial_atlas/tree/main
