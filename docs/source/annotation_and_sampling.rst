Annoations and spatial resolution
==================

1. Consistent Tissue Annotations
------------ 
We recognized inconsistencies in the possibility of obtaining robust tissue annotations from various spatial technologies. For example, Visium (10X Genomics) is often annotated in the "10X Loupe Browser" (https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/loupe-browser/latest), which restricts annotations to a 100Âµm spot-to-spot resolution. For annotation of IBEX (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00644-9) and other imaging-based platforms, users might use tools like the excellent Napari (https://napari.org/stable/), where annotations are done at the pixel level, although specific plugins are constantly developed for various spatial technologies. However, this can be difficult to interact with on cluster infrastructure which bioinformaticians routinely use. This incompatibility, along with the need for a simple, open-source tool to annotate tissues at a well defined resolution and within the popular Jupyter notebook environment, led us to develop **TissueTag** (https://github.com/nadavyayon/TissueTag/tree/main) and we would suggest you try it out on your spatial data!

2. Definition of the spatial sampling resolution
---------------
In addition to the above, I believe it is critical to define the spatial sampling frequency of your CCF and keep constant across samples, conditions and technologies. While this might seem basic it is often ignored! Essentially, each image has its own pixel size which depends on the microscope's configuration and the experimenter's choice. In fact, the spatial sampling resolution is independent of the imaging resolution and can even be higher than the pixel resolution. Practically, we will construct an hexagonal point grid (HPG) in space with a set resolution and which all our calculations would be based on. Like any filter, selecting a spital frequency will affect the ability to capture spatially variable patterns. Thus, the researcher should explore different options and estimate to which degree the spatial variance is represented. 

**In this (extreme) example, selecting a low spatial frequency underrepresents the high frequency structures (capsule) but does captures the broad structures (medulla and cortex).**
