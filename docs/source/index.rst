Welcome to OrganAxis documentation!
===================================

**OrganAxis** is a mathematical approach for the construction of a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) from a set of spatial landmarks.

Key features:

* Can be applied to any spatial platform, at any resolution
* Allows multisample integration of continuous spatial information
* Allows modeling of linear and non-linear spatial associations
* Tunable features to account for local and global spatial environments
* Hypothesis-driven

OrganAxis is implemented to derive the human thymus cortico-medullary axis here - https://github.com/Teichlab/thymus_spatial_atlas/tree/main
